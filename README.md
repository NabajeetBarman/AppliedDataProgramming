# Applied Data Programming

The repository contains various Jupyter notebooks which introduces basic Python modules such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas for basic data analysis, clearning, manipulation and exploratory data analysis.

You can open the notebooks in Google Colab and save a copy to work on the commands and add your own content.

The content is adapted from the masters subject Applied Data Programming that I used to teach students in Masters in Data Science degree program at Kingston University.
