# Applied Data Programming

The repository contains various Jupyter notebooks which introduces basic Python modules such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas for basic data analysis, clearning, manipulation and exploratory data analysis.

The content is adapted from the masters subject Applied Data Programming that I used to teach students in Masters in Data Science degree program at Kingston University.
